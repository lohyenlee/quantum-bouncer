Visualizations of the Feynman path integral for the quantum bouncer

This repository contains a Mathematica notebook with code for creating visualizations of the quantum bouncer.  These include classical paths, caustics (phase diagram), foci, Morse/Maslov index, propagator, and wave packet evolution.
