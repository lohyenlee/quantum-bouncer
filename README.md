Visualizations of the Feynman path integral for the quantum bouncer

QuantumBouncer.nb is a Mathematica notebook containing visualizations, animations, and interactive demos relating to the quantum bouncer.  These include classical paths, caustics (phase diagram), foci, Morse/Maslov index, propagator, and wave packet evolution.

QuantumBouncer.nb.pdf is a PDF of [part of] the notebook.

If desired, we can supply a Python (Jupyter) notebook also.
